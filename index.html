<h1>A Visit to Golden Temple</h1>
<p>A visit to a historical place is always an exciting experience. It is a fascinating adventure. I had one such experience during the last summer vacations, when I visited Amritsar.
</p>With my family, I reached Amritsar by train. After some rest, we undertook a visit to Amritsar. Amritsar is a historical city. We visited the Golden Temple first. The Golden Temple in Amritsar is the holiest shrine of the Sikh region. This Temple has been destroyed many times and had been rebuilt again. It was built during the reign of Akbar, who had great respect for all religions. The domes of the Temple are covered in gold.A visit to a historical place is always an exciting experience.
